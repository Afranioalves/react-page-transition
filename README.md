## Installation

`yarn add @steveeeie/react-page-transition`

or

`npm install @steveeeie/react-page-transition`

## Usage Example ( With React Router )

Wrap your routes inside the `PageTransition` component and pass one of the preset names to the `preset` prop, ([view the demo](https://stevemeredith.com/react-page-transition) for the full list of presets).

You will also need to pass the current `location.path` to the `transitionKey` prop, this is so that the internal `TransitionGroup` can track which components are entering and exiting.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import PageTransition from '@steveeeie/react-page-transition';

function Routes() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route
        render={({ location }) => (
            <PageTransition
              preset="moveToLeftFromRight"
              transitionKey={location.pathname}
              <Switch location={location}>
                <Route to="/home" component={Home} />
                <Route to="/about" component={About} />
              </Switch>
            </PageTransition>
        )}
      />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## Props

`preset` - Accepts one of the available preset names as a string, ([view the demo](https://stevemeredith.com/react-page-transition) for the full list of presets).

`enterAnimation` - Accepts one of the available animation names as a string and overides the enter animation, ([view the demo](https://stevemeredith.com/react-page-transition) for the full list of animations).

`exitAnimation` - Accepts one of the available animation names as a string and overides the exit animation, ([view the demo](https://stevemeredith.com/react-page-transition) for the full list of animations).

transitionKey - Needs to be a unique identifier, it is used by the internal `TransitionGroup` to track which components are entering and exiting.
